# XNA Tools

XNA Tools is a framework I wrote to simplify rapid development of simple applications using Microsoft XNA. This repository contains both an example project with a number of use examples and also a folder with the core code so you can add the necessary components directly into your own projects.

The "Common" folder contains collection of the XNATools required libraries, and an extension XNATools.WndCore.Kinect that contains additional extensions to allow for easy development with the Kinect libraries. KinectLibraryTest contains a sample project that uses all the different libraries. You will require XNA version 4.0 and possibly additional runtimes/development kits for the Kinect side of content.

You will find the core examples in KinectLibraryTest\KinectLibraryTest\KinectLibraryTest. Inside this folder KinectGame.cs does most of the work. And you can find all the examples split into separate folders under the WndContent folder.

You can find a more complete game example using this toolkit that I wrote at: https://github.com/Squirrelbear/KirbyArenaPublic
